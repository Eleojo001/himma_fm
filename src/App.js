Due to the decrease in water usage for agriculture.

        'Assessing the Feed Nigeria Summit 2020: Tackling food insecurity in Nigeria head-on.',
      author: 'JEREMIAH AMEDU',
      content: `When a man rises at dawn, what gives him an assurance of a bright day is not the shining rays of the sunlight or a pleasant weather, but the hope of getting three square meals with the right diet for his family and himself by sun set. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, FAO, while many people may not be hungry in the sense that they are suffering physical discomfort caused by lack of dietary energy, they may still be food insecure.\nThey might also have access to food to meet their energy needs yet they are uncertain that it will last or they might be forced to reduce the quantity, and or the quality of food they eat in order to get by. This various aspect of food insecurity can contribute to various forms of malnutrition and can have serious consequences for health and wellbeing.\n THE FAO goes further by defining food insecurity as a situation where a person lacks regular access to enough safe and nutritious food for normal growth and development and an active and healthy life.\nThis may be due to unavailability of food or lack of resources to purchase or obtain food. Interestingly and somewhat ironically obesity and being overweight is also a indication of food insecurity. This is because uncertainty to access the right kind of food for long periods could lead to physiological changes that can contribute to obesity and overweight which in turn could also lead to severe illness.

      title: 'Not just a Farmer: A Feeder!!!',
      author: 'OLAYEMI DANIYAN',
      content: `Each time a farmer strikes the earth with tools and machines to clear weeds, till the soil, plant crops and harvest it or evacuate dung and feeds for animals to feed, what comes to mind is the implication of his trade. If he decides to stop working, one wonders, where will the food in homes, markets, restaurants, warehouses and silos come from? Farmers play severely vital role in preserving the lives of millions of people. Unfortunately, in many underdeveloped economies farmers remain poor. The question that then comes to mind is why is it so? The simple answer is lack of money: no money to expand their fields or use the latest seeds and technology.

But economists have a more complicated theory. Perhaps, farmers face too much risk as too many factors seem against them. From unfavourable weather issues, to poor yields due to attack on crops by pests, coupled with unfavourable government policies and programmes. Also, a major risk factor especially in the Sub-Saharan Africa is the problem of clashes between farmers and herdsmen due to cows grazing on farm crops. Also unpleasant for farmers is the worsening security condition in rural areas such as kidnappings and assassinations. Besides these challenges is the issue of toil and poor interest in the trade, as a result many young people consider farming for rural dwellers or the old and retired. The situation has made many, especially in Nigeria to drop their tools and leave the farms for other trades.

However, despite these challenges which can be found in many countries throughout the globe, some personalities have faced the odds and emerged wealthy from farming while some other wealthy business investors are expanding their tentacles into farming. This is most likely due to the fact that farmers play a key role in keeping humans alive as everyone has to eat. A clear case is Africaâ€™s richest man, Aliko Dangote who intends to branch into farming by investing $4.6billion in the Nigerian agriculture sector. Mr. Dangote plans to invest at least $3.8billion in sugar and rice and $800m in milk production in the next three years.`,
